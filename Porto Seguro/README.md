## Intro
This was my first Kaggle competition. I entered late and did not really have time to experiment much. I learned a lot in the process and will definitely use some of the tricks and techniques in my next competitions.

The two notebooks here only show some of the code used, in particular none of the Cross Validation work is here. I ended up using two basic models only: XGBoost and Keras (Sequential) Neural Netowrk, mostly as I wanted to practice on their usage. Not much feature engineering was done as I entered the competition one week before the deadline, fortunately not much was needed, as shown by the winning entry.

I finished in the top half of the competitors only using my own code, while it seems a lot of other teams used public kernels. My goal was to learn, so I decided not to use someone else's code just to climb the leaderboard. After the competition ended I had more time to test my models so I was able to achieve some better results.

Time to look into the next competition!
